## About The Project

Quotes is a simple web application that allows you to store your quotes and share them with your friends.

### The Idea

The idea came up after I started writing a quote that I found on the internet in my to-do list app ðŸ˜† and I thought why not create a quotes app, Similar to a to-do list app but it's made for quotes instead of tasks.
